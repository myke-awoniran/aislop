Define your standard once in `.aislop/config.yml` + `.aislop/rules.yml`. Every change your agent makes is held to it automatically. `aislop` catches the slop they leave behind (narrative comments, `as any`, swallowed errors, hallucinated imports, todo stubs), enforces the rules your team sets, and scores every change 0–100. 8+ languages. Deterministic — no LLM at runtime.

### The killer feature: the per-edit hook

Install once into your coding agent:

```bash
npx aislop hook install --claude    # also: --cursor, --codex, --gemini, --windsurf, --cline, --kilo, --antigravity, --copilot
```

After every `Edit` / `Write` your agent makes, `aislop` runs and feeds the diagnostics back into the agent's next turn as structured `additionalContext` (envelope: `aislop.hook.v1` — score, counts, findings, regression flag, suggested next steps). **The agent sees the score regression on the same turn it wrote the code, before you prompt again.** No more PR-time surprises; the slop never leaves the keystroke that produced it.

CI is the second gate: `aislop ci` exits non-zero when score drops below your threshold, so the same standard is enforced on every PR.

Every check is deterministic. Regex patterns, AST analysis, and standard tooling (Biome, oxlint, knip, ruff). Same code in, same score out. No API calls, no LLMs, no network dependency (except optional dependency audits). The name refers to what it *catches*.

## Why aislop

AI coding tools generate code that compiles and passes tests but ships with patterns no engineer would write: trivial comments, swallowed exceptions, unused imports, `as any` casts, oversized functions, and leftover `console.log` calls. These problems are spread across many files and slip through review.

`aislop` gives you one view and one score. Fully deterministic, no AI in the loop.

- **One score, one gate**: a 0-100 number you can enforce in CI with `aislop ci`. Weighted so sloppy patterns (dead code, `as any`, swallowed errors) hit harder than style noise.
- **Auto-fix first, agent second**: `aislop fix` clears what's mechanically safe (formatters, unused imports, trivial comments, dead patterns). For the rest, one flag hands off to Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, Gemini, Windsurf, Amp, Aider, Goose, and 7 more, with full diagnostic context pre-filled.
- **Wire it into your agent**: `aislop hook install` plugs aislop into Claude Code, Cursor, Gemini CLI (runtime), plus Codex, Windsurf, Cline, Kilo Code, Antigravity, and Copilot (rules-only). The agent gets score + findings on the turn it wrote the code, not after.
- **Deterministic**: regex, AST, and standard tooling. No LLMs, no API keys, no network dependency. Same repo in, same score out.
- **Zero-config start**: `npx aislop scan` works on any repo. Add `.aislop/config.yml` when you want to tune thresholds or enable the architecture engine.
- **Works across stacks**: TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, Go, Rust, Ruby, PHP, Expo / React Native.

## What it catches

Six deterministic engines run in parallel:

| Engine | What it checks | How |
|---|---|---|
| **Formatting** | Code style consistency | Biome, ruff, gofmt, cargo fmt, rubocop, php-cs-fixer |
| **Linting** | Language-specific issues | oxlint, ruff, golangci-lint, clippy, expo-doctor |
| **Code Quality** | Complexity and dead code | Function/file size limits, deep nesting, unused files/deps (knip), AST-based unused-declaration removal |
| **AI Slop** | AI-authored code patterns | Narrative comments, trivial comments, dead patterns, unused imports, `as any`, `console.log` leftovers, TODO stubs, generic names |
| **Security** | Vulnerabilities and risky code | eval, innerHTML, SQL/shell injection, dependency audits (npm/pip/cargo/govulncheck) |
| **Architecture** | Structural rules (opt-in) | Custom import bans, layering rules, required patterns |

See the full [rules reference](docs/rules.md).

## Usage

### Scan your project

```bash
aislop scan                # scan current directory
aislop scan ./src          # scan a specific directory
aislop scan --changes      # only files changed from HEAD
aislop scan --staged       # only staged files (pre-commit)
aislop scan --json         # output JSON
```

**Exclude files and directories.** `node_modules`, `.git`, `dist`, `build`, and `coverage` are excluded by default. Add more via `.aislop/config.yml`:

```yaml
exclude:
  - "**/*.test.ts"          # globs supported (micromatch)
  - src/generated
  - legacy
```

Or override per-run with `--exclude` (comma-separated or repeatable, stacks on top of the config):

```bash
aislop scan --exclude "**/*.test.ts"
aislop scan --exclude node_modules,dist,logs
aislop scan --exclude "src/generated" --exclude "**/*.spec.*"
```

CLI flags beat config; config beats defaults.

**Extend a shared config.** A project config can extend a parent and override specific keys. Useful for org-wide baselines: ship one strict config, let each repo soften or tighten as needed.

```yaml
# .aislop/config.yml
extends: ../../.aislop/base.yml   # relative path to a parent config

ci:
  failBelow: 80                   # override just this key, inherit the rest
```

`extends:` accepts a single path or an array of paths. Later entries win. Deep-merged: nested objects (`scoring.weights`, `engines`) are merged key-by-key; arrays are replaced. Circular references and depths beyond 5 are rejected with a clear error.

### Fix issues automatically

```bash
aislop fix                 # safe auto-fixes: unused imports, formatting, lint
aislop fix -f              # aggressive: dependency audit, unused files, Expo alignment
```

### Hand off to your coding agent

When auto-fix can't solve it, aislop generates a prompt with full context and opens your agent. 14 supported:

```bash
aislop fix --claude        # Claude Code
aislop fix --codex         # Codex CLI
aislop fix --cursor        # Cursor (copies prompt to clipboard)
aislop fix --gemini        # Gemini CLI
aislop fix --windsurf      # Windsurf (copies prompt to clipboard)
aislop fix --amp           # Amp
aislop fix --aider         # Aider
aislop fix --goose         # Goose
aislop fix --opencode      # OpenCode
aislop fix --warp          # Warp
aislop fix --kimi          # Kimi Code CLI
aislop fix --antigravity   # Antigravity
aislop fix --deep-agents   # Deep Agents
aislop fix --vscode        # VS Code Copilot (copies prompt to clipboard)
aislop fix --prompt        # print the prompt (agent-agnostic)
```

### Install as a native hook

One command and aislop runs automatically after every agent edit. Findings flow back to the agent as structured feedback (`aislop.hook.v1`) with score, counts, top-20 findings, and next steps, so the agent can self-correct on the same turn.

```bash
aislop hook install --claude           # Claude Code PostToolUse
aislop hook install --cursor           # Cursor afterFileEdit
aislop hook install --gemini           # Gemini CLI AfterTool
aislop hook install                    # every supported agent at once
aislop hook install claude cursor      # pick any subset as positional args
aislop hook install --agent claude,cursor   # comma-list if you prefer one flag
```

Runtime adapters (scan + feedback on every edit): `claude`, `cursor`, `gemini`.

Rules-only installers (agent reads rules on every turn): `codex`, `windsurf`, `cline`, `kilocode`, `antigravity`, `copilot`.

Opt-in quality-gate mode captures `.aislop/baseline.json` at install time and blocks the Claude Stop hook if the score regresses:

```bash
aislop hook install --claude --quality-gate
aislop hook baseline                    # re-capture baseline
aislop hook status                      # list installed hooks
aislop hook uninstall --claude          # remove a specific agent
aislop hook uninstall                   # remove every aislop entry, sentinel-verified
```

Every install is sentinel-guarded (SHA-256 hash fence) for idempotent re-runs and exact uninstall. Full guide: [`/docs/hooks`](https://scanaislop.com/docs/hooks).

### Use as an MCP server

aislop ships an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server so any agent that speaks MCP — Claude Desktop, Claude Code, Cursor, Codex — can call it as a tool.

```jsonc
// ~/.cursor/mcp.json  /  Claude Desktop config  /  ~/.codex/config.toml equivalent
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "aislop": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "aislop-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

Tools exposed:
- `aislop_scan({ path? })` — score + counts + top findings
- `aislop_fix({ path?, force? })` — apply mechanical fixes; returns before/after delta
- `aislop_why({ rule_id })` — engine + docs link for a rule
- `aislop_baseline({ path? })` — read the per-edit-hook baseline (score, lastScanAt, fileCount)

Same engines as the CLI; calling these from inside an agent session lets the model self-check before claiming work is done.

### Use in CI pipelines

```bash
aislop ci                  # JSON output, exits 1 if score < threshold
```

### Common workflow

```bash
# before commit
aislop scan --staged

# during local cleanup
aislop fix

# full project check
aislop scan
```

### Other commands

```bash
aislop init                # create .aislop/config.yml
aislop doctor              # check which tools are available
aislop rules               # list all built-in rules
aislop badge               # print the public score badge URL + README snippet
aislop hook install        # wire aislop into your coding agent
aislop                     # interactive menu
```

See [all commands and flags](docs/commands.md).

## Use in your project

### Pre-commit hook

```bash
npx aislop scan --staged
```

### GitHub Actions

Fastest path: run `npx aislop init` and say yes to "Add a GitHub Actions workflow?". It drops a working `.github/workflows/aislop.yml` for you.

Manual form:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: actions/setup-node@v4
  with:
    node-version: 20
- run: npx aislop@latest ci .
```

Or use the composite action (one-liner):

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: scanaislop/aislop@v0.5
```

### Quality gate

Set a minimum score in `.aislop/config.yml`:

```yaml
ci:
  failBelow: 70
```

`aislop ci` exits with code 1 when the score drops below the threshold. See [CI/CD docs](docs/ci.md) for more.

## For engineering teams

`aislop` runs locally and in your CI. [scanaislop](https://scanaislop.com) is the hosted platform built on top of it for teams that want enforcement without wiring every workflow themselves.

- **PR gates on every repo** with a score threshold and block-to-merge
- **Standards hierarchy**: org baseline, team overrides, project config
- **Per-team dashboards** and agent attribution over time
- **Visual rules manager** so engineering leads set standards without editing YAML
- **Same engines, same rule IDs, same score**. The CLI remains the source of truth.

The CLI is MIT-licensed and always will be. [Learn more about the platform →](https://scanaislop.com)
